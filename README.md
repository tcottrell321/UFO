# UFO

# Descripton of Project
In this module we built a website for presenting UFO Sighting data from a data file. The site is dynamic and data can be filtered by date of sighting by the user. 

# Resources
* The application was written in JavaScript.
* The website was structured using the Bootstrap style grid system.
* An Index.html file formats the majority of the content with minor changes made using a CSS Style Sheet. 
* One image downloaded from Nasa was used for the background. 

# Organization of files
The files were organized under a single master folder entitled UFO
* Subfolder Static
* - CSS Subfolder holding the CSS style sheet
* - Images Subfolder holding the nasa image file
* - JS Subfolder holding the app.js and data.js file

# Challenge 11 
Challenge 11 will add multiple user search fields for City, Country, and other attributes. 
The App.js will need to be modified as well as the Index.html file and possibly the style.css file and bootstrap parameters to accomodate the additional search fields.
